This is my project, created after completing the **Advanced JavaScript course**.

The aim of the project is to develop an app that enhances book reading by integrating the external Open Library service: **Open Library API**.

The app allows you to search for books through the API. You just need to enter a book category and wait for the results to access the information.

The app will display:

-Title

-Authors

Then, by clicking on the bookâ€™s title, you will also be able to read its description.

The user will send a request to the API, for example: https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fantasy.json, where the term "fantasy" represents the book category entered in the input field.
